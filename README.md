Project Personal Library

To make this project work:
1) ADD YOUR MongoDB connection string to .env without quotes as db
    `example: DB=mongodb://admin:pass@1234.mlab.com:1234/fccpersonallib`
2) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes

Work:
1) Created all routes within `routes/api.js`
2) Added security features to `server.js`
3) Created all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js` using Chai.
